Recognized command line arguments:

-club 123
    Digital ID of the fanclub to dump. For example,
    "11791" for https://fantia.jp/fanclubs/11791
    If not specified, user will be prompted

-name ABC
    Specifies the name of the folder to dump data into.
    If not specified, user will be prompted unless 
    "-club" argument is also present, in which case 
    club ID will also be used as a folder name.

-cookiefile FILE
    Tells fantiaimgs to look for a _session_id 
    cookie value in the specified FILE.
    If not specified, "_session_id.txt" file is assumed.
    If specified file does not exist, user will be prompted
    to enter that cookie value manually.

-subp
    Prepends an index of subpost within a post to the filenames.
    Helpful to avoid most naming conflicts when used with "-nh".

-imgnum
    Prepends an index of an image within a post to the filenames.
    When used together with "-subp", subpost index goes first.

-nh
    Removes a small hashsum in the beginning of filenames,
    i.e 1234abcd_File.png -> File.png
    Note that it may cause name conflicts, especially 
    when used without "-subp". In this case, a "+" character
    will be prepended to the newer conflicting name.

-keepthumbnames
    By default fantiaimgs will rename thumbnail files matching
    "^........-....-....-....-............" pattern to "_thumb".
    If this is not a desired behavior, use this switch.

-nometa
    If specified, header image, fanclub icon and BGs are ignored.
